* Hackmode Server
Hackmode server aims to provide 3 things

** Expert system
This will proxy your requests to a local file for you to derive rules from. The initial set of rules will come from my own local files

These rules will then be used to match against your traffic, extract parameters and more. In the future I plan on adding ML to derive new rules experts dint see.
** Processing Pipeline for Recon
Every Single aspect of traffic will be used to enrich further recon.

Http messages will be passed to a msg buss then to expert systems or other scripts you can hook into for automation

All automations can be run by you just opening ZAP and firefox.
** Simple Http API and http database
Self explantory




* Where is the code?
It will be uploaded when it is ready.
